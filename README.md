# RemindMeal

Welcome to the repository of RemindMeal, a web application whose purpose is to allow you to store the meals and dinners you had with your friends and the recipes you cooked, so that you never cook twice the same meal at the same person!

It has been built using the ASP.NET Core Framework, and is actually targetting the .NET Core 3.1 version.
